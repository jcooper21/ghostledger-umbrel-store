# GhostLedger Docker Compose for Umbrel
# ======================================
# This file integrates with Umbrel's app proxy system for seamless access.
#
# Key Umbrel integration points:
# - app_proxy: Umbrel's reverse proxy handles routing to the app
# - APP_DATA_DIR: Persistent storage location provided by Umbrel
# - Network isolation: App runs in Umbrel's Docker network

version: "3.7"

    # No volumes needed - GhostLedger is stateless by design
    # All data is processed in-memory and exported as downloads
    # This aligns with the privacy-first philosophy

    # volumes:
    #   - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data:/app/data
