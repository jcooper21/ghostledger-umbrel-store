# GhostLedger Docker Compose for Umbrel
# ======================================
# This file integrates with Umbrel's app proxy system for seamless access.
#
# Key Umbrel integration points:
# - app_proxy: Umbrel's reverse proxy handles routing to the app
# - APP_DATA_DIR: Persistent storage location provided by Umbrel
# - Network isolation: App runs in Umbrel's Docker network

services:
  # Umbrel's app proxy - routes traffic to our app
  app_proxy:
    environment:
      # Format: <app-id>_<service-name>_1
      # internal service name 'web' resolves correctly in Docker network
      APP_HOST: web
      APP_PORT: 8501

      # Timezone - users can modify in their Umbrel settings
      TZ: "${TZ:-America/Toronto}"
    # No volumes needed - GhostLedger is stateless by design
    # All data is processed in-memory and exported as downloads
    # This aligns with the privacy-first philosophy
    #
    # If persistent session data is desired in future versions:
    # volumes:
    #   - ${APP_DATA_DIR}/data:/app/data
