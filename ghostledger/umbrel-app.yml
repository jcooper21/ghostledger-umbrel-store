tagline: Local-first Bitcoin tax calculator for Canada
description: >-
  GhostLedger is a privacy-focused Bitcoin tax calculator built specifically 
  for Canadian taxpayers. It implements the CRA-required Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) 
  method - the weighted average cost approach that Canadian tax law mandates for 
  capital property.


  All processing happens 100% locally on your Umbrel. Your transaction data, 
  wallet exports, and financial information never leave your device. No APIs, 
  no cloud, no data exfiltration.


  Features include import from Sparrow Wallet CSV exports, automatic ACB 
  calculation with full audit trail, capital gains and loss tracking, 
  superficial loss rule detection (30-day wash sale warnings), and 
  CRA Schedule 3 formatted export for tax filing.


  Upload your historical BTC/CAD prices (from Yahoo Finance or CoinGecko) 
  alongside your Sparrow transaction export, and GhostLedger handles the rest. 
  Perfect for Bitcoiners who value privacy and self-sovereignty in their 
  financial record keeping.
